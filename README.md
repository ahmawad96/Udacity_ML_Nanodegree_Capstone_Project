# ML Nanodegree Capstone Project
This is the graduation project of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.
## Project Overview:
The project is related to computer vision domain and to the work done so far in autonomous vehicles.
The project Addresses In-Lane Autonomous Driving. This means the car needs to learn driving inside a lane and doesn't get off it.
The proposed solution is an End-to-End Convolutional Neural Network that learns from a labeled dataset through supervised learning.
The project consists of two parts divided on two distinct jupyter notebooks and was carried out on google colab GPU environment.

## Dataset:

* The Dataset used is collected by me using my RC car in a manually made lane using white plastic bags.
* The dataset is uploaded to google drive and can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1-YEl1mlH7JojAFyiTxvjkLTpa215IY/view?usp=sharing)

## Requirements:
All python packages/libraries used are found in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
* To install all requirements all at once, create a virtual environment then execute this command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
